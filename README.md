## Description

MealOrganizer is a Shopping List and Meal Planner application that allows the user to set up meals for the week and add all the ingredients and recipes to their shopping list to be checked off and kept organized

MealOrganizer is written with SwiftUI and uses Combine and Core Data for persistance throughout the application. MealOrganizer is very customizable and I hope it helps showcase some of the great use cases of SwiftUI, Combine, and CoreData. Enjoy!
